# React Component Integration Guide

This project provides a React component that can be integrated into your existing React application. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but you can use it in any React environment.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Development

Run the app locally in development mode:

`npm start`

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

Hot reloading is enabled, so changes will appear immediately.

### Production Build

Create an optimized build for deployment:

```
npm run build
```

This generates a build folder with minified, production-ready assets. You can serve these files with any static hosting provider or integrate them into your existing deployment process.

## Waiting List Form

The `WaitingListForm` component provides a basic front-end form for users to join the waitlist. **Important notes:**

- The current implementation only handles front-end submission and displays a temporary success message.
- A **backend solution** is required to actually store or process submitted form data (e.g., via an API or serverless function).
- Additional configuration may be needed for:
  - Validating input fields.
  - Displaying error messages for invalid or failed submissions.
  - Integrating with email services, databases, or CRM systems.

This allows flexibility to connect the form to your preferred backend or service as needed.

## Future Configurability

Currently, the components (e.g., `HeroSection`, `MembershipSection`, `WaitingListSection`, `FaqSection`) use hardcoded content and images. In the next stage of development, these components could be refactored to accept **props** for all textual content, images, and call-to-action links. This would allow:

- Easy customization of headlines, subheadlines, descriptions, and button text.
- Dynamic replacement of images for desktop and mobile.
- Reuse of components in different contexts without duplicating code.

This approach would make the components fully configurable and easier to maintain as content or design changes.
